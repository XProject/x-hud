<p align='center'><b>With Multiple Framework Support (esx-overextended, qbox, esx-legacy, qbcore, & custom framework)</b>

## âš  Attention

-   Make sure you go through all of the config file and modify it as desired
-   If you want the new super snazzy sound effects for the menu, you'll need to download the latest update of [interact-sound](https://github.com/qbcore-framework/interact-sound) <br>
    (comes with new open menu sound, close menu sound, click menu sound, low fuel alert, unbuckled seatbelt alert, seatbelt buckle/unbuckle sound, and etc)
-   If you are using this resource on [esx-overextended](https://github.com/esx-overextended), make sure to have the newly developed version of [esx_status](https://github.com/esx-overextended/esx_status) running which is **NOT** backward-compatible with legacy's esx_status! OR you can modify the source code yourself by heading to _modules/bridge_ folder
